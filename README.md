# SSH_Command_push
SSH example to push 1 single command to the other peer

as it say, simple app that will help you to undergo to send single SSH command to the other peer (such as : raspberry pi, cisco switch, etc.)
place the other peer IP address as hostname
place password

all in the mainactivity, then run the command

to get agile and swift you can later implement a button to push any code from your phone to the other peer with a single click
